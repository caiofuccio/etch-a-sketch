# Etch-a-Sketch

This project aims to create a browser drawing tool inspired by an etch-a-skecth toy. It's part of The Odin Project project list.

## Project Overview

I have created a web page that contains a menu and a drawing pixelated board. You can draw on the pixelated board when you hover your mouse across the board.

The menu will give you the following options:

- The grid-size slider will change the grid size once you stop it at a certain value.
- The color pick button will open a RGB palette that will allow you to choose a drawing color.
- The eraser button will allow you to use an eraser to clean your drawing point to point.
- The clear button will clean the entire board.

When you change the grid size, be aware the drawing will be erased.

## Learning points

- Creation and manipulation of DOM elements using Javascript;
- Creation and manipulation of CSS styles using Javascript;
- Use of event listeners, specially on input changes;
- CSS Media queries for different screen sizes;
- Improving knowledge of methods in javascript;
- Use of concatenated functions to reduce code size;
